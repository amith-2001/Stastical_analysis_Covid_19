# COVID-19 Impact Analysis

This repository contains data and analysis scripts related to our research on the impacts of COVID-19 across multiple sectors, including healthcare, economy, education, and travel. Our research focuses on how measures such as lockdowns and mask usage have influenced various outcomes, including student enrollments and public health metrics.

## Research Questions

1. How did the pandemic affect international student enrollment?
2. What are the correlations between mask usage frequency and COVID-19 incidence and severity?
3. When and where are lockdowns most likely to occur based on predictive modeling?


## Key Findings

- Higher mask usage rates are associated with lower incidence and mortality rates from COVID-19.
- Predictive modeling has identified potential periods and locations for future lockdowns based on COVID-19 case trends.
- International students enrollment saw a steep decline with the rise of Covid-19.
